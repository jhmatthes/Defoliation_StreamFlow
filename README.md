# Defoliation_StreamFlow
This code analyzes the connection between defoliation from a Landsat data produce and watershed-scale water yield, yield:precipitation, and instantaneous streamflow characteristics. It downloads 15-minute data from USGS streamflow gages in southern New England 1995-2017 and precipitation data from Daymet at the same gage locations.

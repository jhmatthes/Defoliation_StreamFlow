# Defoliation_StreamFlow

This code is associated with the publication: Smith-Tripp, S., A. Griffith, V. Pasquarella, J.H. Matthes. TBD. Impacts of a regional multi-year insect defoliation on seasonal water yield and instantaneous streamflow characteristics.

This analysis assesses the connection between defoliation in southern New England during a 2015-2017 outbreak of gypsy moth (*Lymantria dispar*) caterpillars and growing season (June-October) anomalies in water yield, the yield-to-precipitation ratio, and instaneous streamflow characterics from flow duration curves.

The code is organized by: 
1. Extract defoliation values 
2. Download 15-minute streamflow data for 1995-2017 from USGS stream gages in the Southern New England region. 


This code analyzes the connection between defoliation from a Landsat data produce and watershed-scale water yield, yield:precipitation, and instantaneous streamflow characteristics. It downloads 15-minute data from USGS streamflow gages in southern New England 1995-2017 and precipitation data from Daymet at the same gage locations.
